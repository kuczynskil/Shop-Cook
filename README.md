## Inspiration
This is a copycat project of the web application available [here](https://przepisy.pl). The idea for it came to me in the middle of pandemic. Quarantine took away many outdoor activities so I started cooking more as a hobby. I wanted to make a less complex and more user-friendly app (compared to the above mentioned) allowing me to choose the recipes I like, add ingredients to my shopping list and send myself an email, so I can buy the stuff I need in a grocery store.
